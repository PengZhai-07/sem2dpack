# SEM2PACK

## A spectral element method for 2D wave propagation and fracture dynamics, with emphasis on computational seismology and earthquake source dynamics.

--------------------------------
## Features

  * Elastic and inelastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media
  * Rupture dynamics on non-planar faults, with friction and off-fault damage or plasticity
  * High order (spectral) elements on unstructured meshes

### It's based on Marco's thermal pressurization branch, and Chao revised bc_dynflt.F90 and sem2d_read_fault.m. Liuwei added plot_summary.m (a summary figure to compare slip rate, rupture front, and speed) and plot_refine.m (to plot fronts with supershear and subshear).
